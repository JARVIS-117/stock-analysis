# All Stocks Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The code for reviewing the history of 12 stocks across two separate years (2017 and 2018) was running successfully. The target moving forward was refactoring the code to run more efficiently and to have a better backbone to refactor for future purposes depending on the size of the data to be observed.
 
## Results

### 2017 Results

11 of 12 stocks being considered yielded a positive return with 9 of them yielding a return that was at least in the double digits. 2017 was indeed a year for growth with these assets. The code used to initially perform the analysis was refactored to yield performance/efficiency to ~5x as seen below.
